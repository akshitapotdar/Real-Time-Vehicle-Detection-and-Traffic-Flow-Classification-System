> A Python-based computer vision pipeline using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV** to detect vehicles, classify traffic flow per lane, and flag wrong-direction movement in real time.

## 📌 Overview

This system ingests traffic video frame-by-frame, runs YOLOv8 inference for vehicle detection, counts vehicles per lane using ROI (Region of Interest) logic, classifies traffic flow as **Smooth** or **Heavy**, and flags wrong-direction vehicles as safety events.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time vehicle detection** — YOLOv8 model (~90% mAP@0.5) trained on a custom traffic dataset
- **Lane-based counting** — Divides the frame into 3 lanes using ROI logic and counts vehicles per lane
- **Traffic flow classification** — Classifies each lane as `SMOOTH` or `HEAVY` based on vehicle density thresholds
- **Wrong-direction detection** — Tracks centroid Δx across consecutive frames to flag wrong-way vehicles
- **Inference optimization** — Input resizing + NMS threshold tuning → ~30% latency reduction
- **CPU-friendly** — Achieves ~10 FPS on CPU-only hardware
- **Model export** — Supports `.pt` (PyTorch) and `.onnx` (ONNX) formats for cross-platform deployment

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Video Frame → Preprocess (resize to 416×416) → YOLOv8 Inference
     → Lane Assignment (centroid x-position) → Vehicle Count per Lane
     → Traffic Flow Classification (count vs. threshold)
     → Wrong-Direction Detection (centroid Δx)
     → Annotated Output with HUD Overlay
```

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

**Custom Dataset** — Trained on domain-specific traffic footage. Mosaic and scale augmentation were critical for improving small-vehicle recall.

**ROI Lane Counting** — Line-crossing logic per lane proved more reliable than full-frame counting under varying vehicle density and occlusion.

**Optimization** — Resizing input resolution from native to 416×416 and tuning NMS thresholds drove the bulk of the 30% latency reduction on CPU hardware.

**Wrong Direction** — Centroid Δx across consecutive frames cleanly flags wrong-way vehicles without requiring a separate dedicated tracker.

## 📽️ Demo

The HUD overlay displays:
- `VEHICLES DETECTED` — total count in current frame
- `LANE 1 / 2 / 3 COUNT` — per-lane vehicle count
- `TRAFFIC STATUS` — `SMOOTH` (green) or `HEAVY` (red)
- `WRONG DIR` — count of flagged wrong-direction vehicles
- `FPS` — current inference speed

Wrong-direction vehicles are highlighted with a **red bounding box** and `!! WRONG DIR !!` label.
